# UMA Whitepapers

UMA is a decentralized financial contracts platform built to enable Universal Market Access. 

The UMA system consists of two intertwined components: 
1. A specification for self-enforcing contract design patterns, as described in our initial whitepaper published as `UMA-whitepaper.pdf`;
1. An oracle construction, called a _Data Verification Mechanism_ (DVM) that guarantees the economic security of a smart contract and oracle system in a fully decentralized and permissionless blockchain setting, published as `UMA-DVM-oracle-whitepaper.pdf`.

We welcome feedback on our designs and writing. In addition to the PDFs published here on GitHub, both whitepapers are available on Google Drive where comments can be added directly to the PDFs using the Google Drive commenting system (please use the links above). You can also reach us via Twitter @umaproject, by email at hello [at] umaproject [dot org], or via our developer [Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/umaprotocol/shared_invite/enQtNTk4MjQ4ODY0MDA1LWZiYjg3ODY2M2MwZGQ3MDVjZDc1ZjUwNDJkMTA5NDZlNzFlZDYxYmQxOTAwNTY1NmZlNGRjY2IxYzUzNjQ0YjI).
