# UMA Whitepapers

UMA is a decentralized financial contracts platform built to enable Universal Market Access. 

The UMA system consists of two intertwined components: 
1. A specification self-enforcing contract design patterns, as described in our initial whitepaper published [here]( https://github.com/UMAprotocol/whitepaper/blob/master/UMA-whitepaper.pdf);
1. A provably honest, decentralized oracle mechanism.

A second whitepaper describing our decentralized oracle mechanism is in draft form and will be published soon. If you are interested in reviewing this draft, please reach out to us via Twitter @umaproject or by email at hello [at] umaproject [dot org].
